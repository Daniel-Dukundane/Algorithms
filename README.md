# A Collection of useful algorithms and data structures

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Java. <br/>
Tutorials from Structy were used as a reference for the implementation of these algorithms.  
The code is tested and documented. 

## Algorithms Included:

- [x] Max Value
- [x] is Prime
